  <p>Well I made it 1200 miles already, and I passedthrough some interesting places on the way: 

  <ol>
  <li>Walla Walla, WA</li>
  <li>Magic City, ID</li>
  <li>Bountiful, UT</li>
  <li>Last Chance, CO</li>
  <li>Truth or Consequences</li>
  <li>NM, Why, AZ</li>
  </ol>

<h3>July 14, 2012</h3>
  <p>I saw some Burma Shave style signs on the side of the road today:
  
  <blockquote>
  Passing cars, 
  <br>When you can't see,
  <br>May get you, 
  <br>A glimpse, 
  <br>Of eternity."
  I definitely won't be passing any cars.</blockquote>

  <p>My first day of the trip!  I can't believe I finally goteverything packed 
  and ready to go.  Because I'm on a Segway,</br>
  I wasn't able to bring a whole lot with me:

  <ul>
  <li>cellphone</il>
  <li>iPod</li>
  <li>digital camera</li> 
  <li>protein bar</li>
  </ul>
  
  Just the essentials As Lao Tzu would have said, 
  <q>"A journey of a thousand miles begins with one Segway."</q>
